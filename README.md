# Huffman Encoding

This is my Javascript implementation of the Huffman Encoding algorithm, a "optimal prefix code [algorithm] that is commonly used for lossless data compression".


To run:
```
git clone https://github.com/Rileyc2022/Huffman_Encoding
cd Huffman_Encoding
node index.js -o output.txt input.txt 
```
Open output.txt and you will see the compression dictionary.
